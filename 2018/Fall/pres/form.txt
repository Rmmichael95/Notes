# Form
**Form & Matter**: the shape of things & the material it's made of

  - Everything that physically exists has both
* The idea that form & matter are separable is central to architectural theory
  - The Naiku Shrine at Ise in Japan proves a striking illustration of this relationship

# Separation of Form and Matter
  * One way form & matter are separate in architecture is though design
    - essence of architecture is capturing design on a convenient medium, giving
      precedence to form over matter
  * __De re aedificatoria__, by Leon Battista Alberti, is the earliest & most important
    architectural treatise, written in the 1450s

# Drawings and Design
  * There are many types of architectural drawing, the most fundamental distinction
    being between drawing something that already exists & designing something new

## Two Types of Design Drawing
  * Those that give an impression of what the building will look like, typified
      by perspective
  * Those that are drawn accurately to scale, typified by so called "orthographic"
      drawings: plans, sections, & elevations

# Harmonics and Proportion
  * Most buildings are complex objects, collections of forms.
    - These forms are __structural__, __functional__, __ornamental__, or a mix:
      columns, beams, roofs, walls, buttresses, rooms, doors, windows, ect...

## Hamonic Proportions
  * __Harmonic Proportion__: 1:2 numerical ratio; named due to corresponding to musical
                         harmony
  * __Musical harmony__: explained with physics & mathematics--the ratio between
                     the lengths of the strings corresponding to the ratios between
                     the frequencies of vibrations of the strings
  * New breed of intellectual artist/architect of renaissance, aware of concepts
    of harmonic proportion, wanted their building to participate is the __cosmic
    harmony__ that regulated the universe
  * __Proportion__: in architecture is mainly a question of aesthetics

# The Problem of Perspective

## Harmonics and Perspective
  * __Visual Harmonics__: distorted by effects of perspective
  * __Doppler Effect__: pitch distortion caused by the relative movement that can
                     heard every time cars drive past; almost imperceptible before
                     motorized transportation
  * __Perspective__: 1413; invention of this new drawing technique allowing more
                 accurately depicting the world as humans see it
    - Before perspective, objects were positioned according to symbolic significance

# Proportional Systems

## Natural Ratio
  * __PI__: 1.6180339887, is irrational & has some extraordinary qualities attributed
        to the rectangle 1:_Pi_
    - Rectangle said to be most pleasing to human eye
      of organic growth
    - Rectangle called "_golden section_"

## Two Types of Proportional Systems

  * Harmonic system: characteristic of the Renaissance architecture
    - Commensurate: meaning it consists essentially of rectangles formed by whole
                    numbers of squares
  * Geometric system: which may have been used in ancient & medieval periods
    - irrational: although simple in construct, it produces awkward &
                    unwieldy numbers
