# Chapter 1: The Science of Psychology

## Origins of Psychology
  * __Psychology__: Derived from Greek roots _psyche_, "mind," and logos, "study"
                or "_knowledge_"
    - Began to emerge as scientific discipline in late nineteenth century
  * Foundations of psychology as an _experimental science_ is generally credited
    to German scientist, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920)
    - 1879: in Leipzig, Germany, he established the worlds first scientific laboratory
            dedicated to the study of psychology.

### Wilhelm Wundt, Edward Titchener, and Structuralism
  * __Wilhelm Wundt__: Interested in studying mental experiences
    - Windt used _introspection_, which is an attempt to directly study consciousness
      by having people report what they are consciously experiencing
      + He would present subjects with objects & have them describe their impressions
        or perceptions of the object: shape, color, texture, scent, feelings when
                                      holding it
    - Sought to break down mental experiences into their component parts: sensation,
      perception, & Feelings; then discover the rules that determine how these elements
      come together to produce a full range of conscious experience
  * __Edward Titchener__: (1867-1927) Englishman & disciple of Wundt, brought Wundt's
                      teachings & methods to USA & other English speaking countries
    - School of psychology associated with Wundt & Titchener became known as _structuralism_,
      an approach that attempted to define the structure of the mind by breaking
      down mental experiences into their component parts
