# Unemployment
* employed (E), unemployed (U)
* Unemployment rate (ue rate) - % of labor force unemployed
  ue rate = U / LF * 100 = U / (U + E) * 100, to 1 decimal
* Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) - % of working age
  population (WA) in LF
  LFPR = LF / WA * 100, calc to 1 decimal
* Types of Unemployment:
  Fractional - Short-term UE that arises from finding work
  Seasonal - Results from seasonal work
  Structural - Change in skill set
  Cyclical - Trends in business cycle
* The economy is in full employment (FE) when cyclical UE is 0
* Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU) - full employment rate of UE
* Potential GDP - real GDP at FE

# Inflation
* Inflation - overall price level rising
* Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Main measure of inflation
  CPI = Total cost of basket at current prices /
        Total cost of basket at base prices       * 100
        calc to 3 decimals
* Formula to convert $ values from years Purchasing Power
  Amount in YearA = Amount in YearB * CPIA / CPIB
* Real Price = Nominal price * Base Year CPI / Cur Year CPI
* The nominal interest rate (i) is the interest rate usually
  reported and not corrected for inflation
* The real interest rate (r) corrects for inflation
* Types of Inflation:
  Demand-Pull - Caused by increase in AD
  Cost-Push - Caused by decreae in AS

# Income-Consumption
* DI = Income - Taxes = YD = Y - T
* DI = Consumption (C) + Private Savings (S^Private) =
  YD = C + S^Private = Y - T
* S^Private = YD - C = Y - T - C
* C= C0 + C1 * YD
  Autonamous Consumption + MPC * Disposable Income

## Average and Marginal Propensities

* MPC - Marginal Propensity to Consume - % amount spent on C per $ earned
* APC - Average Propensity to Consume - total % of DI spend on C
  APC = C / DI = C / YD = C / (Y - T)
* APS - Average Propensity to Save = 1 - APC
* MPC + MPS = 1

## Interest Rate-Investment Relationship
* Business borrow $ when rate of return (e) > cost of investment
* Important cost of investment is real interest rate (r)
* Businessess will invest as long as e ≥ r

## Savings Supply
* S^Private = Y - T - C
* S^Public = T - G (Gov Savings)
* If T - G > 0 -> budget surplus
  If T - G < 0 -> budget deficit
  If T - G = 0 -> balanced budget
* S^National = Y - T - C + T - G = Y - C - G
             = S^Private + S^Public

* Y = C + I + G (X - M) (in open economy)
* Y = C + I + G (in closed economy)
  - I = Y - C - G - Since S^National = Y - C -G,
    then when Y is in equilibrum, I = S^National

# Tax Multiplier
* k = 1 / (1 - MPC)
* Multiplier effect:
  ΔY = kΔC or
  ΔY = kΔI or
  ΔY = kΔG
* The Tax Multiplier is different:
  t.m.= 1 - k
  ΔY = t.m.ΔT
