# Introduction
  * 1950: architecture theory in America & Europe still makeshift
  * To understand architecture w/it's cultural complexity, it is necessary to grasp
    basic concepts: representation, typology, tectonics, the language metaphor, the
                    organic metaphor, harmonic proportion, & authorship

## Two Distinct Philosophical stands emerge
  * __Phenomenological__: approach typified by
    - popularity of _The Poetics of Space_ by French philosopher Gaston Bachelard
    - revival of an old idea: that architecture can be thought of as a language
  * __Structuralism__: approach to literary criticism
    - originating from France allowed French critical theory to influence smaller
      cultural fields of architectural theory

## Four Main Problems with Architecture Theory
  * First:
    - Overhauling novelty
      - Academia, w/a constant pressure to publish new work, propelled the field
        forward but left nonspecialists behind
  * Second:
    - Emphasis on philosophers rather than themes
      + Over study of philosophical work over more relevant knowledge
  * Third:
    - Obscurity
      + Experts in the field, being so due to their unique knowledge, led new works
        in the field to an abstractness, making for difficult reading
  * Fourth:
    - remoteness from practice
      + Theory taught in architecture schools mainly as a separate specialty

## What is architecture?
  * __Dictionary__: The design of buildings
    - Does this include all buildings, or some?
  - Nikolaus Pevsner: Lincoln Cathedral is architecture, a bicycle shed is a building
    - Building must be designed "with a view to aesthetic appeal" to be architecture
    - Some wish to abolish this distinction, extending the concept of architecture

# Chapter 1: Representation
  * In the book _Age of Divided Representation_ by Dalibor Vesely, the idea of
    architecture is developed as a representational art
  * Paintings and sculpture, w/no clear use, are accepted as representational,
    architecture w/no use is not so easily accepted as thus

## Sculpture and Architecture
  * Obviously representational buildings incorporate paintings &/or sculpture
  * The __Panathenaic frieze__, a relief sculpture incorporated into the __Parthenon__,
    represents a procession which took place annually on Athena's birthday
  * Greek temples made of stone, carry representations of features found in early
    wooden temples, such as __triglyphs__
      - For centuries, western architects have copied ancient architectural details
        to ornament their own buildings
      - classical tradition - ornamenting modern builds w/traditional features

## Columns and Human Figures
  * __Caryatids__ - columns in the shape of human female figures
    - Thought to represent women captured by Spartans during sack of Caria
    - Are these sculpture of architecture?
  * __Doric columns__ - represent sturdy male figures
  * __Ionic Columns__ - represent matronly female figures or horns of sacrificed rams
  * __Corinthian columns__ - represent slender young girls
  * Columns representing human figures in neither pictorial, like the Panathenaic
    frieze, nor reproductive, like classical tradition, but symbolic
  * __symbolic representation__ - buildings can represent aspects of the human experience

## Regularity in Architecture
  * Regularity is normally associated w/architecture. Used metaphorically,
    architecture might describe ordered structure or hidden regularities,
    such as in literary work
  * The Parthenon slightly adjusts what would otherwise be strict mathematical
    regularity.
    - One theory, that the end columns are pushed in to appear regular
    - Not immediately noticing is important
    - Apparent regularity prioritized over actual regularity
  * __Degrees of regularity__
    - __Symmetry__: circular dome has axial regularity, the Parthenon has bilateral
      + Architectural symmetry is not always simple. The symmetry of the __Erechtheion__
        is fragmented and complex
      + __Component parts__: (rostrum, north portico, main body) are individually symmetrical
      + It's composition is asymmetrical
  * non-classical & non-Western also traditionally display some degree of regularity
    & symmetry: Gothic cathedrial, Mayan pyrimads, Chinese palaces
  * Regularity is architectures default.Irregular & asymmetrical builds draw their
    meaning from a deliberate denial of the expected norm
  * rational for regularity on architecture: Efficient use of space, efficient to
                                             construct & assemble parts
    - although regularity has practical roots, it is also symbolic. Pre-Industrial
      age, carving 46 identical 32'9" marble columns is nearly a miracle

## Rhythm in Architecture
  * __Rhythm__ - a term to denote regularity in architecture
    - poet Goethe, called architecture "frozen music"

# Chapter 2: Language
  * Architecture is almost unlike language: Not spoken or heard, written or read
    - In contrast, architecture is static & spatial, extended in three dimensions
  * The idea that architecture is(resembles) a kind of language persists in
    architecture theory despite the inherent differences
    - John Summerson(on classical architecture) - "The classical language of
                                                  architecture" ~ 1950s
    - Charles Jencks wrote the book inaugurating the post-modernist style
      _The Language of Post-Modernist Architecture_ ~ 1970s
  * One way architecture can be seen to speak is by representing its function(gas
    stations houses railroad stations)
    - A linguist would say that they are, "signifiers," for every one of which at
      least one "signified" exists

## Denotation and Connotation
  * St Pancras station, Victorian build, recently renovated & converted into modern
    train train terminal
    - old train shed roof was retained by architects for the restoration, even tho
      it is short for the new configuration of platforms & had to be extended
      + This helped retain the atmosphere
      + Retained meaning by keeping romantic connotations
      + Designers wanted to emphasis those connotations, not destroy them
        * Perhaps why big bronze statue of embracing couple right under crown of
          the arch, the focal point of the space
    - Famous champaign bar nearby, said to be longest in world, takes form of single
      line of tables placed in line w/the platforms, as it's an open train
      + It denotes its function plainly enough
      + connotes secondary meanings associated w/rail travel: speed, luxury, &
        romance

## Sign Systems
  * __Semiotics__: study of sign systems
    - idea that almost every aspect of human culture can be studied as a sign system
    - closely related to the linguistic philosophy Structuralism
  * __Parole__: individual utterances, spoken or written
  * __Langue__: refers to whole body of language that in some sense exists at any one
          time & from which the words that make up the utterance are chosen
    - Can be visualized as a graph
      + parole being the x-axis, left to write over
        time like written word
      + langue being the y-axis, worlds that might have been chosen listed in columns
        beneath those that were
        * Some describe the axis as "diachronic" & "synchronic," meaning extended
          over time & simultaneously available
        * Some argue the distinction between the "synactic" nature of the x-axis,
          governed by grammatical rules of language, & the "semantic," meaning-generating,
          nature of the y-axis
    - The parole/langue mechanism is more subtle than simply choosing the words for
      objects, as if the relationship were static, they create meaning
    * Meaning is negative: A word is defined by all the things it does not mean

## Icon, Index, and Symbol
  * Charles Sanders Pierce - an American philosopher who believed human culture was
    essentially sign-based, tried to develop a complete classification system for
    signs
  * __Three categories__
    - __Icon__: signifier that resembles the thing it signifies
    - __Index__: signifies that "points to" the thing it signifies
    - __symbol__: relationship that a word has to a thing
  * Architects of complex building worry about the "legibility" of their buildings,
    the practical question of navigating the structure. "Signage" becomes an important
    part of design. Generally agreed, less signage you need, more legible design
    - Index: is a signifier especially relevant to architecture--entrance halls,
      corridors, staircases, landings, elevator lobbies--indicate where to go by
      by means of form, scale, & juxtaposition.
    - Icon: more subtle then index, steps signify walking in an iconic way.
  * 1966: _Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture_ by Robert Venturi, whos
          message was buildings can be ambiguous

# Deconstruction
  * Coined by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, a post-structuralist continuing
    the semiotic & structuralist tradition of Saussure, but disagreed w/some aspects
    - main objection to signifier/signified model was implication of these 2 terms
  * 1980s: many architects, notably Peter Eisenman & Bernard Tschumi, adopted
           deconstruction as a basis of a new hybrid style of architecture resulting
           in deconstructivism
  * __Deconstructivism__: word combines deconstruction & __constructivism__, name given
                       experimental Russian architecture of the year following
                       the 1917 revolution

## Collision and Combination
  * 1988: Deconstructivism comes to public attention at exhibition __Deconstructivist
          Architecture__ held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
  * __Wexner Center for the Arts__: one of the earliest examples of a deconstructivist
                              building
    - Designed by Peter Eisnman
    - Completed in 1989
    - building aligned w/both the existing street & campus grids
      + Two grids happen to lie at an angle of 12.25 degrees to each other
        * This dual alignment destroys the rectilinear consistency normally expected
  * __Koizumi Sangyo Corporation Building__: A smaller Eisenman project of the same
                                         period, deconstruction of a philosophical
                                         text reenacted in architectural terms
    - original "text" curtain-walled office building designed by another architect

# Chapter 3: Form
  * __Form & Matter__: the shape of things & the material it's made of
    - Everything that physically exists has both
  * Plato elevated form to the divine by thinking of it as existing in the mind of
    God, eternal & unchanging
  * Aristotle saw both form & matter as dynamic
  * The idea that form & matter are separable is central to architectural theory
    - The Naiku Shrine at Ise in Japan proves a striking illustration of this relationship
  * In nineteenth-century England, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings
    fought against replacing original ornaments w/replica, the original stone had value

![Naiku Shrine](/home/ryanm/Documents/Notes/2018/Fall/img/naikushrine.png)\

## Separation of Form and Matter
  * One way form & matter are separate in architecture is though design
    - essence of architecture is capturing design on a convenient medium, giving
      precedence to form over matter
  * __De re aedificatoria__, by Leon Battista Alberti, is the earliest & most important
    architectural treatise, written in the 1450s

## Drawings and Design
  * There are many types of architectural drawing, the most fundamental distinction
    being between drawing something that already exists & designing something new
  * __Two Types of Design Drawing__:
    - Those that give an impression of what the building will look like, typified
      by perspective
    - Those that are drawn accurately to scale, typified by so called "orthographic"
      drawings: plans, sections, & elevations

## Harmonics and Proportion
  * Most buildings are complex objects, collections of forms.
    - These forms are __structural__, __functional__, __ornamental__, or a mix:
      columns, beams, roofs, walls, buttresses, rooms, doors, windows, ect...
  * Architecture: Combination of forms into beautiful wholes
    - Le Corbusier - "The masterly correct, and magnificent play of forms in light"
  * __Harmonic Proportion__: 1:2 numerical ratio; named due to corresponding to musical
                         harmony
  * __Musical harmony__: explained with physics & mathematics--the ratio between
                     the lengths of the strings corresponding to the ratios between
                     the frequencies of vibrations of the strings
  * __Church of San Lorenzo__ in Florence, designed by Brunelleschi mid-fifteenth
    century, has composition regulated by the harmonic proportions: 1:2, 2:3, & 3:4
  * New breed of intellectual artist/architect of renaissance, aware of concepts
    of harmonic proportion, wanted their building to participate is the __cosmic
    harmony__ that regulated the universe
  * __Proportion__: in architecture is mainly a question of aesthetics

## The Problem of Perspective
  * __Visual Harmonics__: distorted by effects of perspective
  * __ Doppler Effect__: pitch distortion caused by the relative movement that can
                     heard every time cars drive past; almost imperceptible before
                     motorized transportation
  * __Perspective__: 1413; invention of this new drawing technique allowing more
                 accurately depicting the world as humans see it
    - Before perspective, objects were positioned according to symbolic significance

## Proportional Systems
  * __PI__: 1.6180339887, is irrational & has some extraordinary qualities attributed
        to the rectangle 1:_Pi_
    - Rectangle said to be most pleasing to human eye
    - Called the "_natural ratio_" due to corresponding to certain formula features
      of organic growth
    - Rectangle called "_golden section_"
  * __Two Types of Proportional Systems__:
    - _The harmonic system_: characteristic of the Renaissance architecture
      + _Commensurate_: meaning it consists essentially of rectangles formed by whole
                      numbers of squares
    - _geometric system_: which may have been used in ancient & medieval periods
      + irrational because, although simple in construct, it produces awkward &
        unwieldy numbers
    - Both systems claim to reveal hidden aspects of nature or cosmology
    - Both have simple practical functions on building sites

## Modular Co-Ordination
  * Modular co-ordination_: 

## The Modulor

## The Importance of Scale
